# What?

A friend and I chose to do our high school thesis together about the comparison of different collision algorithms.

# Why?

It's one of the most, if not the most crucial part to a video game.
Furthermore, it covers four key areas within engineering sciences: technology, programming, physics, and mathematics.

# Where?

You can find the programming code to our [thesis here](https://github.com/lilBeanstock/Collision-benchmark)!
